# `rah`

`rah` is the `r`eact `a`pplication `h`arness. It is a combination of project management tools, build system, and development server features derived from [`react-boilerplate`](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). I use this to build static single page applications and unify deployment processes. The goal is simple -- making changes to any application built against `react-boilerplate` requires making manual changes to every project that uses it. That's slow, inefficient, tedious, and no fun at all.

To fix that, we've inverted the server and build components of `react-boilerplate`. Instead of forming the basis of your project's folder structure that functionality is now just another module dependency that can be installed like so:

### Installation

```
npm install -D git+ssh://git@github.com:nels-o/rah.git
```

Yah, it is not on NPM yet. Working on that. Turns out someone has this name. 

### Usage through NPM scripts

To use it, you will need to add the following to your `package.json`

```
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node ./node_modules/rah/server",
    "build:dll": "node ./node_modules/rah/internals/scripts/dependencies.js"
    ...
  },
  ...
```

To make use of the CLI to generate containers and components, you will need to add the following to your `package.json`. For example, from the root directory of an application run `npm run generate [option]` Options are container, component, and language.

```
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "generate": "plop --plopfile node_modules/rah/internals/generators/index.js",
    ...
  },
  ...
```

Other functionality is in progress!

## Known issues

### Install time

These issues are not strictly harmless, in the sense that they represent a large amount of ongoing meaintenance work for our codebase, but they do not impact runtime code as of right this second.

### DLL compilation

These are related to the filesize issues that have their own section below.

```
[BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimised the styling of "... /node_modules/lodash/lodash.js" as it exceeds the max of "500KB".
[BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimised the styling of "... /node_modules/brace/index.js" as it exceeds the max of "500KB".
```

### Filesize

Currently, `rahDeps.dll.js` comes in around 2.14 MiB for a _small project_. That's massive by any stretch. We are actively working to get that down to a more reasonable size. The bundle is cached in several tiers, so it isn't usually an issue after first page load. Since our primary target user is a person we have an ongoing relationship with, we can generally assume that they will not regularly see the impact of this bundle size, but that's no reason to be this wasteful.

Application bundles will vary, but we've seen sizes as large as 12 MiB for moderate size projects with a default `react-boilerplate` installation. There is a lot of work to do on this front.
